# Who am I?

Hi! Iâ€™m AudioAnimatronic1874, and I write Plausible Fantasies (aka: science fiction) and Less Plausible Fantasies (aka: just fantasy), which apparently are set in the same multiverse.

I was born in 1st August 2002 in Jakarta, and I am a high school student.

I grew with science fiction. I still remember that time when I watched _Earth vs. the Flying Saucers_ (yes! [that B-movie!!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049169/)) and it blown up my mind. Those awesome power armours. Those awesome spacecrafts. It began my eventual diving on the scifi 'verse.

<p class="lead">With my "craft", I found weird stuff. Awesome stuff. Civilizations that's eons ahead... and eons behind.</p>

But until recently, I haven't dive the scifi lit verse yet. It was a short story, ["The Monster" by AE van Vogt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GZioay51Dl0HbnZP4pG6ZlATT1N3LL1V/view?usp=drivesdk) which compelled me to read more.
