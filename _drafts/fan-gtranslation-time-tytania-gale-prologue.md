The blurb (with edits by me):

> In S.Y. (Stellar Year) One, the "Federation of Interstellar Cities" was established in the galaxy, and each city had a trading house that owns the city fleet while protecting the economic activities of its citizens. During that time, the biggest rival of the Federation was the Valdana Empire. The two sides were often defeated in battle, but the Federation's dominance was infallible. However, one catastrophe occurred in Year SY 228. A family called Tytania broke out and turned to the Valdana Empire. And the following year, the cover of "The Battle of the Braunwald Range" was cut off. The Federation was completely defeated and cast a black shadow in the "age of the Federation", which seems to last forever.

> _"The whole series of Yoshiki TANAKA, who is looking forward to it, is delivered here. With illustrations from Katsumi MICHIHARA, this space opera departs with the best combination. What more will you need to do? Readers only open the main door. The drama that echoes in the magnificent universe created with the power of the whole body is only moved with more excitement than that representative work!" --Tokuma Shoten staff_

#### PROLOGUE

## TYTANIA RISING

... The periodization of time is just a convenience when writing and reading historical textbooks. Although it is often thought so, it is safe to say that segmenting times is the ultimate goal of historical research. Because, how to set the period classification, and how to set it, is reflected in the person's basic view of history in a straight line.

When human activity was once limited to one planet, the Earth, there were four easy time divisions. It is that of ancient times, medieval times, modern times, and modern times, and there were times when modern times were added to this.

On top of this basic division, special situations in each area are added. In art history, science and technology history, literary history, economic history, etc., time division often produces a general time division and a gap. The gigantic imperial grave also has no effect on the art and ideas of making sculptures.

If this is compared with military history, it can be seen that the biggest turning point was the use of explosives. However, in terms of changes in military thought, there was also a cynical view that there had been no change basically since Sun Tzu. In addition, some people saw the division of the era with the complete emergence of the two major tides of military thought, "mechanism and quantity" vs. "attack", but then it became a problem when they first appeared, and it was not easy to see the connection.

In the political and social divisions, the use of "Stellar Year" (SY), that is, the year when the base of human society moved from the earth to other celestial bodies, was divided into the "Early Age" and the "Post-Early Age" Is common. This, together with the fact that the Common Era was abolished and the SY was used, clearly brought about a change in certain consciousness.

The so-called "Gagarin Calendar" is the border of the periodization of time, with the year Yuri Gagarin first made space flight in history in 1961. A similar thing is the "Apollo calendar", which is the year when human beings first marked footprints on other objects in the earth in 1969, and that is the year of the year. It is probably just success, and it is probably not correct that there has been no change as in the whole of humanity (U. N. Devar). After Gagarin and Apollo, the universe was an occupation of professional technologists, and it did not become a living space for humanity.

By converting tachyons to bradyons, faster-than-light speeds were obtained. The system was completed in 2420 CE, and this completion was an opportunity to explosively expand human society into the outer space. This recognition was a very rare example, in which facts and truths are almost identical, and it can be said that it is since the Industrial Revolution.

The age of development was the age of optimism. Also in the epidemic, there were more economic goodies such as "Don't be afraid of failure!" or "Fly before you see!". The population also increased, resulting in a pyramidal population structure. Within the solar system, the population, which had been stationary with around five hundred billion people, topped one billion in sixty years. By 2500, it reached fifteen billion. During this time, FTL and its accompanying technology had been improved, safety to the human body had increased, and further the population outflow to the outer space had been promoted, and the geographical area of human society had continued to expand.
