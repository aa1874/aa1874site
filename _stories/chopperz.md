Oh, hi! How are you back there? I've just managed to test my own time machine—I successfully travelled to 2135 CE!

I now live in Jeketion, a community region built above the region once known as Jakarta.

Here in Jeketion there are no skyscrapers like in your times—the people here realised that skyscrapers would have destroyed the environment. The highest building here is about 150 metres tall. But what I saw is that residential areas are mostly low-rise and mostly located in rural areas; I saw that a form of helicopter is now a common thing here.

Also, I have no need for money here—things are abundant here, and people would work a 10 hour week. Most of the work here are carried out by machines. People would convene in the district council and tell the council what they need that day, so they can be procured to other communities if they couldn't produce it here. I just requested a new house and chopper for me to live in.

I also saw many other technological advances that's not available in your time. Like, for example, humanity is now a member of a galactic federation. (I heard you like space operas and you would be a famous writer of space operas in the future..)

Ok. I must end this letter here. The movers are here and they will move my furniture to the new house that I told you. I must move to the new house now—or else the house will be given to another person.

Oh if you want to reply, send your reply to my house at your time. My housekeeper is ready to send your letter to the future.

Oh, if you're curious, here's my new address:
Drni
3-5-8
Jeketion 355-94

I'll wait for your reply. See you later!

Yours, Drni
