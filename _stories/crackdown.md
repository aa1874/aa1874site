**Crime Event Report**

Place of crime: Lyokk, H43-Ka

Day of event: The planet's Incorporation Day*

Sequence of events:  
Scheduled events celebrating the planet's incorporation included a military parade by the ICPS Defence Organ and several events organized by Central Command.

Insurgency began to rise almost at the middle of the Defence Organ Parade. At the time insurgency began to rise the Commander of H43-Ka, \[NAME REDACTED\], was having a speech to the attending Defence Troops and some other native civilians. At that precise time a voice was heard screaming "Long live Leader Karn!" and immediately someone killed the Commander; most of the Defence Troops immediately commune around him.

We received the command letter a few Vashkiran minutes after the death of the Commander. The command is that we must hunt any form of insurgency in the planet, imprison them and put them in re-education camps.

Battalions dispatched to H43-Ka are the \[REDACTED\] Battalions, totalling \[REDACTED\] clone soldiers. These battalions form the entirety of our Insurgency Eradication Team.

Upon arrival, we told the team to split up and turn on their mindscanners, and after we confirmed that their mindscanners are all on, we programmed the scanners to detect any thoughts of insurgency. Some parts of the team are tasked to scan from the air, then perform assault immediately upon detection.

That way, crackdowns and arrests took less than one local rotation*. About \[REDACTED\] insurgents are arrested and now they are in our safe hands. We will later judge them, those that are guilty will be sent to re-education camps.

NOTES:

* Incorporation Day: the day when planet H43-Ka began to be occupied by the Interstellar Co-Prosperity Sphere. One of the Sphere's most important centre for resources, planet H43-Ka was invaded in \[TIMESTAMP REDACTED\] and is officially incorporated by the Sphere in \[TIMESTAMP REDACTED\].
* Local rotation: the time needed for a planet to perform a complete rotation.
