**AUTOMATED PA in platform 3:** The next train arriving in Platform 3 is the Keijrok Limited, the 1654 InterPlanetary service to Keijrok Central, calling at Myldr'hyd, Sudlon, Lyrog, and Keijrok Central.

This train has 20 double-deck carriages. Sleeping cars are in the lower decks of cars 1 to 11, first class are in both decks of cars 13 to 15, standard class are in the upper decks of cars 1 to 11 as well in the both decks of cars 16 to 20. Dining services are provided in car 12.  
For your safety, please remain clear from the yellow line.

**ANNOUNCER:** May I have your attention please! Please avoid Platform 6 and 7, as those platforms are being sterilised for the arrival of His Highness the Prince of the Kensorr Principality.

**AUTOMATED PA in platform 1:** May I have your attention please--this is a safety announcement! It is prohibited to bring any hazardous material in the F-Rails system without consent. Should you find anything suspicious, please report to the nearest staff immediately. Thank you!

_Someone saw another person bringing a suspicious material nearby. He reported it to a policeman:_

**SOMEONE:** Help! I found someone bringing something suspicious! There!

**POLICE NEARBY:** STOP! STOP! POLICE!! HANDS IN THE AIR!!! You're going to be interrogated of bringing suspicious material.

_The man bringing the suspicious material was immediately arrested by the police, and was taken immediately to the security office for interrogation._

**AUTOMATED PA in platform 5:** The next train arriving in Platform 5 is the Principal Train.

**ANNOUNCER:** Please leave platforms 5 and 6 sterile for the arrival of His Highness the Prince of Kensorr. Except for press and without consent, it is prohibited to access both platforms until the Prince leaves the station and officers declare the platforms safe for general use.

_The Keijrok Limited arrived._

**AUTOMATED PA in platform 3:** Syklis! Syklis! Exit from the right hand doors. Change here for services to Dilm and Harkol. This is the Keijrok Limited, the 1654 InterPlanetary service to Keijrok Central. The next station calling is Myldr'hyd.

_A huge flock of people were disembarking the Keijrok Limited. The planet Syklis was a tourist destination, and this was the holiday season for many of the service's passengers; by looking at the passenger disembarking frequency, the train might terminate in Keijrok with a lack of passengers. The flock of people would transfer to the local trains not operated by F-Rails._

_Later on the Principal Train arrived. The press took many images of the train as well as the Prince and his guards._
