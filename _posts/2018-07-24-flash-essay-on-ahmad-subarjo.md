Ok. My school wanted me to make an essay on Ahmad Subarjo (Most of the info are from Wikipedia)

He was a diplomat, first Indonesian FM (foreign minister) and actively against imperialism everywhere. He even spent 2 mo in Berlin and Moscow for the League against Imperialismâ€¦ He later became a member of BPUPK (Investigating Committee for the Preparatory Work for Independence)

Later, he was appointed as first Indonesian FM in 1945 and 1951-52. And then he was Indonesian ambassador to Switzerland 1957-1961.

Due to complications, he died at 82 in RSPP hospital, Jakarta. He was awarded a national hero predicate in 2009.

Imo he is a great hero, actively against imperialism and colonialism. We need antiimperialist diplomates like him.
