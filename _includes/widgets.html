<p><b>THIS WEBSITE IS UPDATED LESS FREQUENTLY.</b> I need a computer to update this website 'cuz this site is hosted on a GitHub repository. It's kinda hard to update it on mobile. Maybe I need to return to Forestry again...</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> Nevermind. I've returned to Forestry again after a few months parted. I hope this could increase the website's update frequency, even if it's just a bit.</p>
