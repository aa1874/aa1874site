I still remember reading what I believe is the manhwa duology ~~Quiz! Science Common Sense~~ no, it's _Science Lessons in Movies_ which was translated here...

It's a manhwa that debunks science in many movies and series. I still remember reading the first book and now I've bought both books...

I still remember parts of the first book. It told me that:

* Godzilla (or should I say Zilla, cuz it's the 90s Hollywood version)'s foot is implausible
* Spider-Man can't shoot webs
* Superman can't fly
* Night vision would hurt ppl
* [Hypersleep chambers](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Hypersleep_chamber) are impossible
* Lightsabers are impossible
* **Captain Harlock is antagonist in _Galaxy Express 999_ (!!!) Do they crossover in one part?** I still remember one section saying that "the Arcadia (Captain Harlock's ship) is, in _Galaxy Express 999_, the Big Bad"

I'm going to reread it again and planning to review it (and book 2) here.
