There is a legend surrounding the forest of Denshun and the bridge in the intercity highway "N325" connecting it and many parts of this world. They said that when you cross the bridge by vehicle, you must horn three times...or else you will disappear from this world. And you will be transported into a magnificent place. Or is it?

I was part of the "Denshun Expedition Team", formed by me and my friends Met_53 and RenDicGGG. Ren said that one day, he received a strange delivery for him. The postman said that it was for his dad... from a person in Denshun. Inside was a letter IN A TRANSPARENT PAPER, and some coins with the words "CITY OF DENSHUN" inside. (Ren actually convinced us to believe that his dad once went to Denshun. It was until he bring those deliveries to us that we began to believe it.)

So we decided to drive on the N325 to prove if the Denshun legend was right. It took a few hours' drive until we saw it. The sign. It had a symbol for the bridge. "I heard this bridge has an anomaly. If you didn't horn thrice there, you will disappear from this world!" Met said. But we decided to ignore his advices and pass the bridge without horning.

The bridge was pretty small. It had 2 lanes, one in each direction, with the width being the same as the main carriageway. The area around the bridge were farmlands--built during the time when my place of domicile was a Terran colony. Yes, you heard it: This place was used to be invaded by Terrans. (In history books they said that Terran troops attacked many of our kind!) But nevermind about that.

There was also a little tavern near the bridge. I saw that in front of the tavern there was a monument. It had the words for "VISIBLE CITY AHEAD". But there were no cities. Just forests.

We drove the road without horning, and suddenly...

Things were changing all around us. The forests! The farmlands! They were disappearing. Everything were disappearing! There were only white all around us.

We kept driving.

The white colour eventually faded to a plethora of colours. The colours 'sharpened' as we kept driving... Then all around us were majestic buildings. Many of them were white... We could also see roads.

We stopped and parked on the side of the road, and we got out of our vehicle. The city was strange.
