_BACKGROUND NOTE:_  
_In 325 DE a civilization of the Dersk Council began re-arming radically. A news reporter captured the scenes of the mass re-arming and posted it on newspapers and "networks", creating a buzz all around the Council member countries._

_This buzz later came to the discussion of the Council government. A "scanner", intelligent drones used for surveying, was later sent to the re-arming civilization to see what was happening._

_The result was staggering..._

To: Kelidorn Mirn-34, Dersk Council department for Extracouncil Affairs

I just heard from a Scanner that a member civilization of our Dersk Council has just threatened the existence of a non-member civilization.

According to the scanner, the civilization was arming; it saw many people being drafted to the civilization's military. It explained that the civilization is prepping for the invasion of the said non-member civilization "for safety reasons".

But why destroying another civilization if it's only making things worse? I fear a war here. And war is inhumane! It's barbaric and doesn't even go with our values. We at the Dersk Council have a rule that states that any civilization making contact must be offered to join the Dersk Council if the contact message arrives at a member civilization.

So here's my resolution: Tell the said civilization that's trying to destroy the other non-member civilization to STOP maneuvering for invasion. Or we will threaten their membership on the Council.

Yours
