*This story is set on the Chouverse, a public domain shared universe.*

It has been centuries after the part-carbon, part-silicon race which inhabited the planet Dyrnik, known as one of the most intelligent and most advanced in the Furkin star system, established their latest colony. During one half of those centuries the Dyrnikian population has increased steadily until they finally developed a perfect cloning system, It's just a part of a bigger technological singularity—the population began to rocket in a steady acceleration rate thanks to its ever-increasing use. The colonies couldn't accomodate the ever-increasing population anymore.

The Central Council of the Dyrnikian Commonwealth knew about this problem. They wanted to tackle it. They have 2 options on the table: perform population control, or restart the colonisation programme. After many meetings and a referendum in which all the citizens of the Commonwealth participated, they decided and passed a bill to allow another colonisation programme to start, which established the Terraform and Colonisation Council.

For years, the Terraform and Colonisation Council has researched some candidate planets that could be terraformed and/or colonised. And they found it. The planet, known for them as Audorn, was located on the habitable zone, but according to the data the Planetary Survey Satellite P-246 sent eons ago during the Colonisation Heyday, the planet was unhabitable for their kind.

And so they'd launched another satellite to scan the planet again, to verify whether the planet is still unhabitable or not. The results are still the same-Dyrnikians can't colonise it-but aerial scans sent by the satellite showed that it had changed. Drastically.

Later the Council decided to form a team, of 35 people, to examine any anomalies on the planet. It was led by Dyrnik's legendary explorer, Ryshun Kassh.

And when the time has came, the team took off with the Dyrnikians' centuries-old flagship, the Contactor--it was a cuboid looking ship, with one part slanted and in some part "interrupted" with cylinder shaped sections for the ship's drive system.

With a drive that folds the space around the ship, it took them about a day or so to go to Audorn. At the time the ship entered Audorn's atmosphere, they could see grasslands and forests. So Ryshun sent a message to Command with some aerial imagery of Audorn attached-those images gave a clearer view of the change that the rover satellite had reported.

Command replied. "But could it sustain future Dyrnikian colonists without a space suit?"

Ryshun immediately dispatched an atmometer pod. From the data that the pod has collected, he concluded that it couldn't sustain the Dyrnikians which breathed air of oxygen and nitrogen. As the air outside only contain oxygen.

"No," he replied, "As the atmosphere is not compatible for our kind, yet these plants might show that this planet actually sustain life."

"Alright. Ryshun, just now the rover satellite orbiting Audorn has found some signs of hot-blooded lifeforms there. Could you find and investigate those lifeforms? Oh, and also, could you investigate any signs of ancient civilisations once living here?"

"Roger that, we'll comply immediately," said Ryshun.

As they landed, the team decided to split up. 10 of them went to scan for any alien relics there. This included Ryshun, who led the detachment. 

The detachment began to turn on their radar detectors. It took them some time to search for relics. No results. One of the detachment members suggested, "Should we split even further? It seems like there are no relics that we can find right now."

"Hmm... let me think," replied Ryshun. "Okay then. We'll split into groups of two. Make sure radicom to be on at all times," he continued.

So the detachment split up. Ryshun and his companion, YarrKynn, decided to launch a vehicle to search for relics. Ryshun took a rod-shaped device from his utility belt, and said to it:

"Launch Small Capacity Flyer!"

He pointed the rod to the grasslands.

From one end of the rod, a nanosubstance emerged which later shaped into a vehicle for them. They embarked and started the vehicle drive. The flyer levitated up to about three kuls-that's about six kilometres-their search has just begun.

And they found one. A low-rise building, still intact. They lowered their flyer to see the structure clearer.

"Is that a Terran building?" YarrKynn asked.

"I don't know, but looking at the architecture, it might be one," Ryshun answered.

"Shall we examine the structure from ground level?"

"Hmm... Ok then, let's examine the building."

They've landed on a forest not far from the structure, and later Ryshun used the rod-shaped device again. "Two an-grav booster boots, please," he told the rod, which he then point into the ground. Two boots appeared from the rod. They wore the boots and immediately the boots began to levitate.

They've had a little racing game to the structure in which YarrKynn won. As they began to see the building from ground level, the building looks rather dull. Still, they began to examine the building's exterior facade. has a tall door, and next to it are inscriptions written in a language unknown to them.

Or is it on an ancient language?

I tried to use the universal translator but the auto-detection feature failed to gave any translations of the writing.

I thought that this building was abandoned, looking at the quality of the building. As a man of interstellar culture, I know that the architecture of this building is like those 1970s Terran buildings: the so-called "brutalist" architecture (what a bad name anyway).

But when I finished examining the exterior and decided to try to go inside, the main entrance door opened when I pushed it. Again, I was kinda surprised... I began to examine the interior.

It was mysteriously maintained well! All the devices and things that are identified as electric powered, was working perfectly. There's a bank of escalators and another of lifts, all the lighting are working perfectly even though I can't see the source of the building's light.

Ah! I forgot to send Council Command a message about this discovery—I've just sent a message to them that I found a maintained building in Audorn's D-Wardsec.

I continued examining the interior. There are several corridors, and a so-called "atrium." Something typical from Terran buildings...

I wonder if Terrans once colonized this planet before.

But then, something caught our senses...
