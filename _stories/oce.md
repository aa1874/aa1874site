*jakarta 2021.04.01*

Nevermind that this city kinda sucks.
Yeah, this city has went downhill
since those pro-business people went to power.

They are really friendly to extremists here.
Those extremists smoothen their way to power
by threatening people.

----

Instead of developments, we got memes.
Corruptions.
Lies.

They went to power to
make themselves even richer.

Criminals have ruled this city for years
and should we take it over from them?

----

Ah, I don't know.
I just don't want anyone to be angry
'cuz they are power vampires.

I only hope that the elections next year are peaceful.
